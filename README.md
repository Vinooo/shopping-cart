Shopping Cart - BDD example of Scala
====================================

Application built with the following (main) technologies:

- Scala 2.11.2

- SBT 0.13.5

- Specs2 2.4.2

Introduction
------------

Satisfy the given requirements:

Step 1: Shopping cart
- You are building a checkout system for a shop which only sells apples and oranges.  
- Apples cost 60p and oranges cost 25p.
- Build a checkout system which takes a list of items scanned at the till and outputs the total cost
- For example: [ Apple, Apple, Orange, Apple ] => Â£2.05
- Make reasonable assumptions about the inputs to your solution; for example, many candidates take a list of strings as input
 
Step 2: Simple offers
- The shop decides to introduce two new offers:
 - buy one, get one free on Apples
 - 3 for the price of 2 on Oranges

Setup
-----

To get you going with this application, just follow along:

In a directory where you wish to clone this project from git:
> $ git clone https://github.com/davidainslie/shopping-cart.git

Go into the application's new project directory (with the "cd" shown) and complete the following:
> $ cd shopping-cart

> $ activator

> [shopping-cart] $ update-classifiers

> [shopping-cart] $ gen-idea sbt-classifiers

> [shopping-cart] $ test

Hopefully all (unit) "specs" will pass and you can now open up IntelliJ and start going through "The Code" as explained below.

The Code
--------

Step 1: Shopping cart (tagged as Step 1)

CheckoutSpec is the starting point, that has examples covering the stated behaviour.

The ShoppingCart is a simple case (domain) class and items such as Apples, Oranges are represented as case objects. Why? I did first code these as case classes with "price" declared in an items's constructor. This is fine for different types of say apples with varying prices, but the requirements/behaviour only state "apple" and "orange", so I wanted a single price per item. And why not choose an Enumeration? Habit I guess, related to using Akka. And why case objects and not just objects? That comes down to more of a preference, but if these objects did not need serialization, and performance was an issue, then objects would be preferred.

A final note regarding money. As can be seen, from the implementation, Checkout, and domain objects, that I have immediately chosen BigDecimal. This is far better than using Double, but in a real application, one should chose a 3rd party such as Joda Time, or even better, Squants.
